# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform. We take security seriously and are committed to ensuring the security and privacy of our users' data.

## Supported Versions

The following versions of the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Only the latest minor version within each major version will receive security updates. We recommend always using the latest version to ensure you have all security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate the work of security researchers in improving the security of our platform. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly** or on GitHub Issues
2. **Email your findings to security@example.com**
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested mitigations (if available)
4. **Allow time for assessment and response** before any public disclosure

We are committed to the following response timeline:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days, we will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability
- **Remediation Plan**: Within 14 days, we will provide a plan for addressing the vulnerability
- **Fix Implementation**: Timeline will depend on the severity and complexity of the issue

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we will acknowledge your contribution in our security release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Practices

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform implements the following security practices:

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure password storage using Bcrypt
- Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- Secure session management with token rotation

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest using AES-256-GCM
- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Secure key management with regular rotation

### Code Security
- Regular security scanning of code and dependencies
- Static application security testing (SAST) using CodeQL
- Container vulnerability scanning using Trivy
- Secret detection to prevent credential exposure

### Security Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging of security-relevant events
- Regular security testing and vulnerability scanning
- Automated security scanning on all pull requests

For more detailed information about our security architecture and practices, please refer to our [Security Documentation](docs/security.md).

## Security Updates

We regularly release security updates to address vulnerabilities. Security updates are provided in the following ways:

1. **Patch Releases**: For critical security issues, we will release patches as soon as possible
2. **Minor Releases**: For less critical issues, security fixes will be included in the next minor release
3. **Security Advisories**: We will publish security advisories for all security-related updates

We recommend configuring your deployment to receive notifications about new releases and updating promptly when security updates are available.

## Security Compliance

The Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform is designed to support compliance with common security standards while operating in a fully local deployment. The platform implements security controls that can help organizations meet their compliance requirements, including:

- Data privacy controls
- Access control mechanisms
- Audit logging capabilities
- Encryption of sensitive data

Since the platform operates entirely locally without external dependencies, organizations can implement additional compliance controls specific to their regulatory environment as needed.
