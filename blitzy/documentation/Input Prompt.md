## WHY - Vision & Purpose

### Purpose & Users

We are solving the problem for small to mid-cap pharma users by providing an application that interfaces with an engine predicting chemical and molecular properties for small molecule drug discovery. The application will:

- Accept a CSV file containing a **SMILES column** and associated numerical property values.

- Allow users to **sort, filter, and organize** molecules into different libraries based on user-defined specifications.

- Enable users to **save, flag, and queue molecules** for different experimental workflows.

- Provide a **seamless workflow** between computational data aggregation and CRO (Contract Research Organization) services.

- Include an interface for CROs to receive molecule submissions, interact with users, set pricing, and return assay data.

The core users are **small pharma** managing molecular data and **CROs** providing wet lab testing services. This platform **streamlines the molecule-to-CRO pipeline**, making interactions efficient and organized.

## HOW - Planning & Implementation

### **Deployment Strategy**

- System must be **fully deployable locally** using Docker containers.

- Deployment should be **streamlined** using a **multi-container Docker setup**.

- Local **Docker Desktop** should be sufficient for setting up the full application.

- No cloud or external hosting dependencies should be required for full functionality.

----------

## **Final Notes**

This system must be **completely independent**, relying on **no external APIs** for any core functions. All functionality, from authentication to AI processing, will be handled **locally**. Deployment will be simplified using **Docker**, ensuring seamless installation and operation on any local machine.
