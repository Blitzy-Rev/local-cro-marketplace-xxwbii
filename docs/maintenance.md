### System Downtime Response

#### Initial Assessment

1. Verify the outage scope (specific component or entire system)
2. Check monitoring dashboards for alerts or anomalies
3. Review logs for error messages
4. Determine if the issue is related to infrastructure or application

#### Triage and Resolution Steps

1. **Container Issues**
   - Check container status:
     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```
   - Review container logs:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs [service_name]
     ```
   - Restart failing containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose restart [service_name]
     ```

2. **Database Issues**
   - Check database logs:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs postgres
     ```
   - Verify database connectivity:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready
     ```
   - Check for database locks:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa ON pl.pid = psa.pid;"
     ```

3. **Network Issues**
   - Verify network connectivity between containers:
     ```bash
     docker network inspect molecule_platform_network
     ```
   - Check external connectivity:
     ```bash
     curl -v http://localhost:80
     ```

4. **Storage Issues**
   - Check disk space:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```
   - Verify volume mounts:
     ```bash
     docker volume ls
     docker volume inspect [volume_name]
     ```

#### Escalation Procedure

1. If the issue cannot be resolved within 30 minutes, escalate to the next support level
2. Contact on-call engineer using the emergency contact list
3. For critical production issues, assemble the incident response team
4. Document all actions taken in the incident management system

### Data Corruption Response

1. Immediately restrict access to the affected data
2. Assess the extent of data corruption
3. Identify the source of corruption
4. Determine the last known good backup
5. Develop a recovery plan
6. Execute recovery procedures as outlined in the Backup and Recovery section
7. Validate recovered data integrity
8. Document the incident and preventative measures

### Security Incident Response

1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Assess the scope of the breach
4. Contain the incident
5. Eradicate the threat
6. Recover affected systems
7. Conduct post-incident analysis
8. Update security measures based on findings

## Container Management

### Health Monitoring

Container health is monitored through:
1. Container-specific health checks
2. Resource utilization metrics
3. Application-level health endpoints

#### Health Check Configuration

Ensure all containers have appropriate health checks in the docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

### Container Restart Procedures

#### Graceful Restart

For routine maintenance or non-critical updates:

```bash
# Restart a specific service
docker-compose restart [service_name]

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart
```

#### Forced Restart

For unresponsive containers:

```bash
# Force recreation of containers
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate [service_name]
```

### Image Updates

#### Update Procedure

1. Pull latest images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   ```

2. Apply updates with minimal downtime:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --no-deps [service_name]
   ```

3. Verify service health after update:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   curl http://localhost/health
   ```

## Database Maintenance

### Performance Optimization

#### Query Performance Analysis

1. Identify slow queries in logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres grep -i "duration" /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log
   ```

2. Analyze query plans:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM molecules WHERE smiles LIKE '%C%';"
   ```

### Index Maintenance

1. Check for unused indexes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0;"
   ```

2. Check for missing indexes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_live_tup > 100000 AND seq_scan > idx_scan;"
   ```

### PostgreSQL Vacuuming

1. Configure autovacuum settings in postgresql.conf:
   ```
   autovacuum = on
   autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 50
   autovacuum_analyze_threshold = 50
   autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1
   autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05
   ```

2. Manually vacuum the database:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres vacuumdb --analyze --verbose --all
   ```

## Storage Management

### MinIO Maintenance

1. Check bucket status:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec minio mc admin info local
   ```

2. Check disk usage:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec minio mc du local
   ```

3. Heal storage (if using distributed mode):
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec minio mc admin heal local
   ```

### Storage Capacity Planning

1. Monitor storage growth trends
2. Set up alerts for storage capacity thresholds (70%, 80%, 90%)
3. Plan for storage expansion when capacity reaches 70%
4. Document storage expansion procedure

## Backup and Recovery

Regular backups are essential for disaster recovery. Refer to the comprehensive disaster recovery procedures in the backup_procedures.md document.

### Backup Verification

1. Regularly test database backups:
   ```bash
   # Restore to a test database
   docker-compose exec postgres pg_restore -U postgres -d test_restore /backups/molecules_db_backup.dump
   ```

2. Verify file integrity:
   ```bash
   # Check backup file integrity
   sha256sum /backups/molecules_db_backup.dump > /backups/molecules_db_backup.checksum
   ```

### Recovery Testing

Quarterly recovery testing should be performed following the disaster recovery procedures.

## Security Maintenance

### User Access Review

1. Review user accounts quarterly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY role, last_login;"
   ```

2. Review inactive accounts:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_login < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';"
   ```

3. Audit role assignments:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d molecules -c "SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;"
   ```
