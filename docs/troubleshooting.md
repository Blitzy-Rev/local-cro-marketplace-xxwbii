# Introduction

This troubleshooting guide provides comprehensive information for diagnosing and resolving common issues with the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform. The guide is organized by system component and includes diagnostic steps, common issues, and resolution procedures.

The platform consists of multiple containerized components working together to provide molecular data management and CRO integration capabilities. When issues occur, a systematic approach to troubleshooting can help quickly identify and resolve problems.

This guide is intended for system administrators, IT support staff, and technical users responsible for maintaining the platform. It assumes basic familiarity with Docker, command-line interfaces, and the overall architecture of the system.

# General Troubleshooting Approach

When troubleshooting issues with the platform, follow these general steps:

1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Gather information about the issue (error messages, affected functionality, timing)
   - Determine which component is likely involved
   - Check if the issue is reproducible

2. **Check System Health**:
   - Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml ps`
   - Check system resource usage: `docker stats`
   - Use health check endpoints: `curl -s http://localhost/api/v1/health/live`

3. **Check Logs**:
   - View container logs: `docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs [service_name]`
   - Check application logs in Kibana (if available)
   - Look for error messages or warnings

4. **Isolate the Issue**:
   - Determine if the issue is with a specific component or system-wide
   - Test related functionality to narrow down the problem
   - Check if recent changes might have caused the issue

5. **Apply Resolution**:
   - Follow component-specific troubleshooting steps
   - Apply the appropriate fix
   - Verify the issue is resolved
   - Document the issue and resolution

For critical issues affecting system availability, refer to the Incident Response section for escalation procedures.

## Using the Health Monitoring Script

The platform includes a health monitoring script that can help diagnose system issues:

```bash
./scripts/monitor-health.sh -v
```

This script checks the health of all system components and provides detailed output about their status. Options include:

- `-v`: Verbose output with detailed information
- `-c`: Continuous monitoring mode
- `-i <seconds>`: Set the interval for continuous monitoring

Example output:

```

Overall System Status: âœ… HEALTHY
```

If any component shows an error, refer to the specific troubleshooting section for that component.

## Accessing Logs

Logs are essential for troubleshooting. Access logs using the following methods:

1. **Docker Container Logs**:
   ```bash
   # View logs for a specific container
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs [service_name]
   
   # View logs with timestamps
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs --timestamps [service_name]
   
   # Follow logs in real-time
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs --follow [service_name]
   
   # View last 100 lines
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=100 [service_name]
   ```

2. **Kibana Log Interface** (if deployed):
   - Access Kibana at `http://localhost:5601`
   - Navigate to "Discover" to search and filter logs
   - Use the pre-configured dashboards for common log views

3. **Log Files**:
   - Application logs: `/var/log/molecular-platform/`
   - Container logs: Managed by Docker's logging driver

When examining logs, look for:
- ERROR or WARNING level messages
- Exception stack traces
- Timing information for performance issues
- Authentication or authorization failures
- Database query errors

## Checking System Resources

Resource constraints can cause various issues. Check system resources using:

```bash
# View resource usage for all containers
docker stats

# Check host system resources
top
df -h
free -m
```

Common resource-related issues:

1. **High CPU Usage**:
   - Slow response times
   - Background tasks taking longer than expected
   - Container restarts due to health check failures

2. **Memory Exhaustion**:
   - Container crashes with "Out of Memory" errors
   - System becoming unresponsive
   - Swap thrashing

3. **Disk Space Issues**:
   - Failed writes or database operations
   - Backup failures
   - Log rotation failures

4. **Network Bottlenecks**:
   - Slow file uploads or downloads
   - Timeouts in inter-service communication
   - Connection failures

If resource constraints are identified, consider:
- Scaling up container resources in `docker-compose.yml`
- Cleaning up unused data and containers
- Adding additional storage
- Optimizing resource-intensive operations

# Container and Deployment Issues

Issues with containers and deployment are common starting points for troubleshooting as they affect the entire system.

## Container Not Starting

If containers fail to start or keep restarting, follow these steps:

1. **Check Container Status**:

   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc stat myminio/bucket_name/path/to/file
   ```
   Examine file metadata for issues.

4. **Verify Presigned URL Generation**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc share download myminio/bucket_name/path/to/file
   ```
   Test presigned URL generation.

5. **Check Bucket Policies**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc policy get myminio/bucket_name
   ```
   Verify bucket access policies.

**Common Solutions**:
- Update bucket policies to allow downloads
- Fix presigned URL generation in application code
- Check for file path encoding issues
- Verify file permissions in MinIO
- Ensure correct content type is set for downloads
- Check for network connectivity issues between services
- Verify that file references in the database match actual files in storage

## Storage Capacity Issues

If storage capacity problems occur, follow these steps:

1. **Check Disk Usage**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec minio df -h
   ```
   Verify available disk space.

2. **Analyze Bucket Usage**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc du myminio
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc du myminio/bucket_name
   ```
   Identify which buckets are using the most space.

3. **List Large Files**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc find myminio/bucket_name --larger-than 10MB
   ```
   Find large files that might be consuming space.

4. **Check for Temporary Files**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc ls myminio/temp-files
   ```
   Look for temporary files that should be cleaned up.

5. **Verify Lifecycle Policies**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc ilm list myminio/bucket_name
   ```
   Check if lifecycle policies are configured.

**Common Solutions**:
- Implement or fix cleanup jobs for temporary files
- Configure lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup
- Add more storage capacity to the MinIO volume
- Archive old data that is rarely accessed
- Implement file size limits for uploads
- Optimize file formats to reduce storage requirements
- Use compression for large files

## CSV Processing Issues

If CSV file processing is failing, follow these steps:

1. **Check CSV File Existence**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc ls myminio/csv-uploads/path/to/file.csv
   ```
   Verify the CSV file was uploaded successfully.

2. **Examine CSV File Content**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend mc cat myminio/csv-uploads/path/to/file.csv | head
   ```
   Check the format and content of the CSV file.

3. **Verify CSV Processing Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs backend | grep -i csv
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml logs worker | grep -i csv
   ```
   Look for error messages related to CSV processing.

4. **Check Background Task Status**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec redis redis-cli -n 1 keys "celery-task-meta-*"
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec redis redis-cli -n 1 get "celery-task-meta-[task_id]"
   ```
   Verify the status of CSV processing tasks.

5. **Test CSV Parsing**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml exec backend python -c "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('/tmp/test.csv'); print(df.head())"
