"""
Database migrations package for the Molecular Data Management and CRO Integration Platform.

This package contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.
Migrations provide version-controlled schema changes that can be applied
and rolled back in a consistent manner across all deployments.

This empty file makes the directory a proper Python package, which is
required for Alembic to properly discover and execute migration scripts.
